</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the summer vacation,
one year, Josephine and
Edward Brown spent a month
with Flora Lee and her brother.
The visitors were distant
relations, and lived in the city
of New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Josephine was a pretty little
girl, but she had a very
bad habit which made for her
a great many enemies. It
is a common fault, not only
among children, but among
grown-up people, and which
often makes others dislike
them.</p>

<p>My readers shall see this
fault for themselves, as the story
advances, and I hope they
will understand and avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Perhaps Josephine was not
so much to blame as her parents
for this bad habit. I am
sure she did not understand,
and did not know, why her
companions soon took a dislike
to her.</p>

<p>Josephine and Edward were
very much pleased with the
home of Mr. Lee, and for several
days they were as happy
as the days were long. They
were not used to the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and it seemed to them just as
though they should never be
tired of running in the fields,
and of visiting the woods and
the river.</p>

<p>One day, after they had
been playing very hard in
the orchard, the children all
went into the house to rest
themselves. Josephine threw
herself upon the sofa in the
sitting room, and said she was
tired almost to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Of course she did not mean
so, and only intended to say
that she was very tired, though
I think it likely that, if an excursion
to the woods or the
river had been proposed, she
would not have been too tired
to join the party.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please to bring
me a glass of water, Flora?”
said Josephine, after she had
rested a little while.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Flora, rising, and getting the
glass of water for her friend.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” added Josephine,
as she took the glass,
and drank its contents.</p>

<p>Flora, when she had given
her the water, happened to
think of something in the entry
which she wanted, and
went for it.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please to take
this tumbler, Frank?” said
Josephine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Frank did not make any
reply, but rose from his seat,
took the glass, and put it
upon the table.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Frank; I never
was so tired in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure of
that?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for it,” replied
Frank, rather dryly.</p>

<p>“Why are you so sorry?”</p>

<p>“Edward and I are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
fishing; and father said Flora
might go with us.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice,” exclaimed
Josephine, jumping
up from the sofa, as fresh as
though she had just got out
of bed. “I will go too.”</p>

<p>“You?” said Frank, laughing.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I go? You
know I like to go to the river
above all things. Won’t we
have a nice time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“<i>We</i> will, I think.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean to let
me go? Come, now, I think
you are real rude, Frank,”
pouted the young lady from
New York.</p>

<p>“Let you go? I am sure
I shall not prevent you from
going.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, then?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say just now
that you were tired almost
to death? that you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
never so tired in your life before?”</p>

<p>“I was; but I feel rested
now.”</p>

<p>“You got over it very
quick.”</p>

<p>“Are you going, Josey?”
asked Flora, as she returned
to the room.</p>

<p>“To be sure, I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are all ready. It
is ten o’clock now, and father
said John might go with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
us at that time,” said Frank,
moving towards the door.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” replied Flora,
who had brought her rubbers
in from the entry.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Josephine.
“Dear me! my rubbers are
up in my chamber. Won’t
you go up and get them for
me, Flora?”</p>

<p>Flora went up stairs and
got the rubbers for her, and
Josephine thanked her for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
kindness. The boys were waiting
in front of the house with
their fish poles on their shoulders,
by this time, and, as
boys always are when they
are going fishing, were very
much in a hurry.</p>

<p>“O, dear me!” exclaimed
Josephine, when she had put
on her rubbers. “I left my
sack in the orchard. Please
to go and get it for me,
Flora, and I will make Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
wait for us till you return
with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will get it;” and
she bounded away for the
missing garment.</p>

<p>“We never shall get to the
river at this rate,” said Edward,
when his sister had
told him the cause of the
new delay. “It all comes of
having girls go with us.”</p>

<p>“There is time enough,
Master Edward,” added John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the young man who worked
in the garden and helped take
care of the horses. “You will
be tired enough before dinner
time.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Flora. She is
a dear good girl. I am very
much obliged to you,” said
Josephine, as she took the
sack. “Now I will be ever
so much more obliged to you
if you will go into the house
and get me one of those nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
doughnuts, such as we had
for supper last night. I am
almost starved.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better not
go a-fishing then,” added Edward,
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Why not? Can’t I be
hungry and go a-fishing?”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to wait all
day for you.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Flora
joined them again; but the
poor girl was sweating, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
out of breath, she had run so
fast in supplying the wants
of her little New York friend.</p>

<p>“I believe we are all ready
now,” said Josephine, as she
took the doughnut and began
to nibble at it, just as a
mouse nibbles at a piece of
cheese.</p>

<p>“If you are not, we will go
without you,” replied Edward,
whose patience, as the reader
has seen, was by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
proof against his sister’s repeated
delays.</p>

<p>“There! as true as I’m
alive, there is one thing more.
I have forgotten my sunshade,”
exclaimed Josephine.</p>

<p>“Never mind your sunshade.
What do you want
of a sunshade when you are
going a-fishing?” said Edward,
as he moved down the
path towards the road.</p>

<p>“O, I can’t go without my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sunshade. I should be as
brown as an Indian before we
got back.”</p>

<p>“No matter if you are.
Come along, or else stay at
home, and not bother us any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Please, Flora, won’t you
go up in my room and get
it for me? I will do as
much for you any time. And
we will walk along, and you
can overtake us before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
have gone far. We will walk
slowly.”</p>

<p>It is very likely that Flora
thought her young friend was
imposing upon her; but without
making any reply, she ran
for the sunshade. She had
to look in quite a number
of places before she found it,
for Josephine could not always
tell where she had left
her things; and when Flora
overtook the party, she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
so weary and out of breath
that she did not enjoy the
rest of the walk very much.</p>

<p>Do not my readers see
by this time what Josephine’s
fault was?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not know how many
fish the boys caught, but I
do know that Flora almost
wished she had staid at home,
for when she got to the river
she was so tired she could
hardly stand.</p>

<p>Flora could not help feeling
that it was not kind of
her friend to ask so much of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her. She was not her mistress,
and was just as able to
wait upon herself as Flora
was to wait upon her.</p>

<p>Yet she was patient and
kind, and did not quarrel with
her. Josephine was always
polite when she asked these
favors, and always thanked
her when she had done them.
Perhaps this made the matter
a little better, though I
think her politeness was cunning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
rather than kindness of
heart.</p>

<p>I have another story to tell
of Josephine and her friends,
which will still further illustrate
her fault, and show how
she was cured of it.</p>

<p>A few days after the fishing
excursion, Flora’s mother
said she might have a picnic
party in the woods on the
other side of the river. To
add to the pleasure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
occasion, Mr. Lee had a tent
put up in the woods, and
erected a swing for the children.</p>

<p>The boys and girls were
delighted with the plan, and
Flora and Frank invited all
the children in the neighborhood
to join the party.</p>

<p>They were to start at nine
o’clock, or as soon as the dew
was off the grass. The distance
to the woods was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a mile, and the children said
they would much rather walk,
though Mr. Lee offered to
carry them over in a large
hay wagon.</p>

<p>There was one little girl
who was too lame to walk
this distance, and Frank said
he would draw her in his
little wagon. To divide the
load, and add to the pleasure
of all, he fastened a long
rope to the pole of the wagon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and all the boys, about fifteen
in number, were to take hold
of the rope, just as men draw
an engine.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the happy
party had collected in front
of Mr. Lee’s house, each one
having a little basket of provisions
which were to furnish
the noonday feast in the
grove.</p>

<p>“Well, Josey, are you all
ready?” asked Flora, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
pleasantly, as the clock struck
nine.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I am. Let
me see. Dear me, no; I left
my gloves up stairs. Won’t
you go up and get them for
me, Flora?” replied Josephine.</p>

<p>“Is there any thing else
you will want?” asked Flora,
for she could not help thinking
that her friend had made
her run up and down stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
half a dozen times on similar
occasions.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not, Flora.”</p>

<p>But no sooner had Flora
returned with the gloves, than
Josephine thought of something
else. After a while,
however, she got every thing,
and the party started for the
woods.</p>

<p>The boys led the procession,
drawing the wagon after
them. Frank and Edward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
had the pole, and they were
very careful lest the little
lame girl should be upset and
hurt.</p>

<p>The girls at once followed,
and when they had gone a
little way, Flora thought it
would be nice to sing one of
their school songs. So they
went singing on their way, as
happy as the larks in the
morning.</p>

<p>“What fine apples!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Josephine, as the party
were passing Mr. Lee’s orchard.</p>

<p>“They are very fine looking
apples, but they are not ripe,”
replied Katy Green, who was
walking near her.</p>

<p>“I think they must be ripe.
They look good, at any rate.
Won’t you be so kind as to
get me one of them?”</p>

<p>“They will make you sick
if you eat them,” said Katy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“O, no, they won’t. If you
will get me one, I will be very
much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Even Katy Green, who was
not very well acquainted with
the New York miss, could not
resist this appeal, and she accordingly
climbed over the
fence and got two or three
of the apples which she found
on the ground.</p>

<p>As Katy had said, the apples
were not fit to eat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
they were thrown away. They
had gone but a little farther
before Josephine saw some
more apples, which looked
very nice.</p>

<p>“I am sure those apples are
ripe. See how red they are.
I know they are ripe,” said
she.</p>

<p>“Those are Baldwin apples.
They are not fit to eat till
winter comes,” replied Katy.</p>

<p>“I am sure they must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
ripe. I have eaten just such
apples as those in New York
in the summer. Will you be
so kind as to get me one?”</p>

<p>“They are not ripe, I tell
you,” answered Katy, impatiently.
“I have known the
tree for ever so many years,
and I know just as well as
any thing can be that they
are not ripe.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you be kind
enough to get me one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
them?” persisted Miss Josephine.</p>

<p>“If you want one you may
get it yourself,” said Katy.</p>

<p>“How very rude you are!”
replied Josephine.</p>

<p>“Rude?” sneered Katy.
“Do you suppose I want to
climb over that fence for nothing?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t such a very dreadful
thing to climb over that
fence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Then why don’t you do it
yourself?”</p>

<p>“You are used to things of
the kind, and I am not.”</p>

<p>“If you want green apples,
that are of no use to any one,
you had better get used to
climbing fences, for I shall not
do it for you any more.”</p>

<p>Josephine declared that this
speech was very rude indeed;
and perhaps it was; but it was
plain common sense. The little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
New York lady was so angry
that she left Katy, and
went to walk with Jenny
Brown.</p>

<p>After the party had crossed
the bridge, the boys took down
the bars by the side of the
road, and they entered the
woods. There was a fine
smooth road leading for several
miles through the forest,
and the children enjoyed the
walk very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Every few moments Josephine
saw something which
she wanted, and instead of
trying to get it herself, as she
should have done, she asked
somebody to bring it for her.</p>

<p>In one place she saw some
checkerberry plants growing;
and, at her request, Jenny
picked her a handful of them.
Then she wanted a swamp
pink, which Jenny also procured
for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>But Josephine’s wants were
so many, that Jenny soon got
tired of supplying them; and
she was obliged to ask some
one else to wait upon her.</p>

<p>One after another, her companions
got tired of her, and
either refused to wait upon
her, or left her. She would
have called upon Flora, but
she walked by the side of
the lame girl, and was busy
talking with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Josephine wanted but very
few of the things which she
asked others to get for her.
She had a habit of <i>wanting</i>
all the time, and did not seem
to be easy unless some one
was waiting upon her.</p>

<p>At home, her father had
plenty of servants, and she
did not realize that her friends
and companions had any thing
to think of besides her comfort.
But even servants should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
be treated with kindness, and
children should not call upon
them, or others, to do for them
what they can just as well do
themselves.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the party reached the
picnic ground, Josephine had
more wants than ever. She
called upon this one to bring
her a mug of water, and upon
that one to get her a doughnut;
upon one to hold her
shawl while she arranged her
dress, and another to take off
her rubbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>If she had been a queen,
and all the rest of the children
her servants, she could
not have been more free in
her use of them. Before they
had been in the woods a single
hour, almost all her companions
disliked her greatly,
and tried to avoid her.</p>

<p>She was selfish, and wanted
to use the swing all the time.
When she had swung four
times as long as any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
rest of the party, she thought
it was “very rude” of them
when they said she must get
out, for they would not swing
her another time.</p>

<p>After dinner, some of the
girls said they were going to
get some oak leaves to make
chaplets for their heads.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”
asked Josephine.</p>

<p>“O, into the woods, ever
so far,” replied Jenny, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
did not want her to go with
them.</p>

<p>“I will go, too,” said Josephine.</p>

<p>“It is as much as half a
mile to the place,” added
Jenny; “and I am afraid you
will get very tired.”</p>

<p>“I think I can stand it as
well as the others.”</p>

<p>“We are used to running
in the woods, and you are a
city girl, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“I want to go very much.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want you to go,”
said Katy Green, bluntly.</p>

<p>“That’s very rude of you to
say so,” replied Josephine. “I
don’t see why I shouldn’t go,
if I wish.”</p>

<p>“You can go, if you will
only wait upon yourself,” said
Jenny.</p>

<p>“Wait upon myself? How
very rude that is! I’m sure
I’ve only asked you to do one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
or two little favors for me,
and you call that waiting
upon me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be unkind to her,
girls,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> doesn’t call it waiting
upon me when she does a
little favor for me. I am sure
I am willing to do as much
for you as you do for me.”</p>

<p>“Let her go with you, girls—won’t
you?” said Flora.</p>

<p>For Flora’s sake they consented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
though they did not
like to have her with them.</p>

<p>“But how shall we bring
the leaves?” asked Jenny.
“We shall want as many as
a bushel of them, for we must
all go home with crowns on
our heads.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can
do,” added Katy. “We can
take the little wagon. That
will hold a bushel.”</p>

<p>“So we can; and it will hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
more than a bushel. Come
along; we are all ready.”</p>

<p>Katy and Jenny were the
two girls who were going for
the leaves, and one of them
took hold of each side of
the pole of the wagon. They
started off at a brisk pace,
Josephine following behind
the wagon.</p>

<p>“Pray, don’t go so fast; I
can’t keep up with you if you
do,” said the New York miss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I can’t help it. You may
go back if you can’t. We
are in a hurry. We shall
not get our chaplets made till
dark if we don’t make haste
with the leaves.”</p>

<p>Josephine was obliged to
quicken her pace, or be left
behind; but she complained
a great deal of the rudeness
of the girls in walking so fast.</p>

<p>After they had gone some
distance, she saw some curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
leaves, and she wanted a
few of them. She said, half
a dozen times, she wished she
had some, and finally asked
Katy if she wouldn’t be so
very kind as to get her a few
of them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll get them,” said
Katy; and in a moment she
had procured some of the curious
leaves and given them
to Josephine.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
I am very much obliged to
you,” said she, as she took the
leaves.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I want something
more than ‘thank you,’”
replied Katy.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?”
asked Josephine, not a little
surprised at the answer she
had received.</p>

<p>“You said you were willing
to do as much for us as we did
for you. Did you mean so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Well, I suppose I did.”</p>

<p>“We will be fair with you—won’t
we, Jenny?”</p>

<p>“To be sure we will.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is no more than
fair that you should take turns
with us in drawing the wagon.
So you may take hold of the
pole, and make yourself useful.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you be so very kind
as to help draw the wagon?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
said Katy, imitating the polite
tones of the New York miss.</p>

<p>“I can’t draw it. I am not
strong enough to do such hard
work.”</p>

<p>“You can try it, at least;
and when you get tired I will
take your place.”</p>

<p>“I would rather not, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“But I had much rather you
would, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Really, I cannot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“But, really, you must.”</p>

<p>“I could not do such a
thing as draw that wagon.”</p>

<p>“You must try; if you
don’t, we will run away and
leave you.”</p>

<p>Josephine thought this was
more rude than any thing
else they had done; but there
was no escape, and she took
her place at the pole of the
wagon.</p>

<p>Before they had gone ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
rods, she declared she could
draw the wagon no farther, if
they killed her for refusing.
Katy took her place then, and
pretty soon they left the road,
and went into the thick forest,
to a place where there was
plenty of oak leaves growing
near the ground.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot,
Josephine sat down on a rock.
Her companions tried to make
her help them pick the leaves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
but she said she was so tired
she could not possibly do any
thing.</p>

<p>In a very short time the
body of the wagon was filled
with leaves, and the girls were
ready to return to the picnic
grounds.</p>

<p>“We are going, Josephine;
are you ready?” asked Jenny.</p>

<p>“I can’t go yet. I am tired
almost to death.”</p>

<p>“We told you you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
be; but you would come,”
said Katy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was so
far.”</p>

<p>“We told you how far it
was. We have been here
ever so many times before,
and know all about it. Come,
quick.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel able to walk
back,” sighed Josephine.</p>

<p>“Don’t you, indeed?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I can’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“What are you going to do—stay
here all night?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you draw me back
on the wagon? There is room
enough for me on top of the
leaves.”</p>

<p>The girls made no reply;
but both of them laughed as
though something very funny
had happened.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing
at?”</p>

<p>“Do you think we are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to drag a great girl like
you back to the grounds? I
guess not,” replied Katy.</p>

<p>“I should think you might.”</p>

<p>“We don’t like you well
enough to do that,” said Katy;
and then both of the girls
laughed again.</p>

<p>“You needn’t laugh at me,”
said Josephine, beginning to
cry.</p>

<p>“O, you needn’t cry; we
didn’t hurt you any. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
come along, if you are coming.
We can’t wait here any
longer.”</p>

<p>“I can’t walk back. You
<i>must</i> draw me back in the
wagon,” sobbed Josephine.</p>

<p>“We shall do nothing of the
kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall. If you
don’t, I will tell Mr. Lee.”</p>

<p>“Do, if you like.”</p>

<p>“I will stay here, then, if
you won’t drag me. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
will you tell Flora when she
asks for me?”</p>

<p>“Tell her where you are,
of course.”</p>

<p>Josephine did not believe
they would go away and
leave her there alone. She
thought they would return in
a little while, and consent to
draw her in the wagon; so
she let them go.</p>

<p>She sat on the rock and
cried till she had got tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of crying, and then finding
her companions did not return,
she got up and tried to
find her way to the road.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Josephine</span> was not used to
the woods, and she did not
know which way to go to find
the road. She had paid no
heed to the path by which she
had reached the place where
the leaves were obtained.</p>

<p>She had been so vexed and
angry, because her companions
would not let her ride,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
that she had not even looked
to see which way they went
when they left her.</p>

<p>She sat on a stump and
cried till she was tired of
crying, and till she found it
would not get her out of the
woods. Then she got up, and
looked around her; but she
could not tell in what direction
the road lay from her.
She listened, and could hear
no sound. It was plain that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Katy and Jenny had left her
alone.</p>

<p>The solemn stillness of the
forest awed her, and she was
afraid to stay there, with no
human being near her. Once
a cat-bird uttered a terrible
scream, and Josephine had
nearly fainted with terror.</p>

<p>She thought it must be
some awful monster to make
such a hideous noise, and as
soon as she was able to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
so, she ran away from the
spot as fast as her feet would
carry her.</p>

<p>As she hastened through
the bushes, and over the dry
leaves, a partridge, alarmed
by her presence, rose from
the ground, and flew away,
making a whirring noise with
his wings that made Josephine
scream with terror.</p>

<p>The poor girl wandered
about for two hours in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
woods, till she was so tired
she could walk no longer.
She thought of the Children
in the Woods, and others who
had been left in the forest,
and she was afraid she should
never see her friends again.</p>

<p>I think she was more frightened
than hurt, for there was
nothing in the woods that was
disposed to injure her. The
cat-birds, the partridges, and
even the snakes, if there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
any there, were more afraid
of her than she was of them.
If they saw her, they would
run away as fast as they
could.</p>

<p>Josephine sat down upon a
log, and wished she had not
been so angry and stubborn.
She even thought it was not
fair of her to ask the girls
to draw her in the wagon.</p>

<p>While she was thinking of
what she had done, and wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
what would become of
her, she heard footsteps in the
distance, and presently one of
the boys shouted her name
with all his might.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” replied Josephine,
getting up and walking
in the direction from which
the sound had come.</p>

<p>In a moment she saw Frank
Lee; and pretty soon half a
dozen of the boys came up to
the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Where have you been, Josephine?
We have been looking
for you for more than an
hour.”</p>

<p>“I have been trying to find
my way to the road.”</p>

<p>“You are ever so far from
the road,” said Frank. “Why
didn’t you go back with the
girls?”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t let me ride
on the wagon.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they?” added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
her brother, who was one of
the party. “That was too
bad, Josey, for you to ask
them to drag you.”</p>

<p>“I was so tired that I did
not feel able to walk,” replied
Josephine, who wanted to give
the best excuse she could.</p>

<p>“We won’t stop to talk
about it now,” added Frank.
“Father and mother have
come, and you can tell them
all about it, Josephine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The boys led the way back
to the picnic grounds; but Josephine
was so tired she could
hardly get back; and when
she joined the party, she was
completely worn out by the
fatigue and anxiety of her
lonely walk.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Lee
said any thing about the matter
till they got home. They
came in the carryall, and Josephine
rode back. The rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of the children walked home,
singing like larks all the way.</p>

<p>“You got lost in the woods,—did
you, Josephine?” said
Mrs. Lee, in the evening.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. Those rude
girls left me alone, when they
knew I could not find the way
back,” replied Josephine, who
wished to make her side of
the question appear as well
as she could.</p>

<p>“Is that the whole story, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
child?” asked Mrs. Lee, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“I wanted them to draw
me in the wagon, and they
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that asking rather
too much of them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but it was;
but they needn’t have left me
there all alone.”</p>

<p>“What could they have
done?”</p>

<p>“I think they needn’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
left me,” repeated Josephine,
not very pleasantly.</p>

<p>“You insisted on going
with them, though they told
you they were going a long
distance, and you would be
very tired. I don’t think you
can reasonably blame them.”</p>

<p>“They knew I wasn’t used
to the woods.”</p>

<p>“You told them that you
wouldn’t go with them unless
they drew you on the wagon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
You might have followed them
without any difficulty.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think they would
leave me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what else
they could do. You would
not go with them; and the
least they could do was to let
you have your own way.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go with them
again,” pouted Josephine.</p>

<p>“They did not want you to
go with them. It was only at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Flora’s request that they consented
you should go. Josephine,
you have got a bad
habit, which I hope you will
cure before long.”</p>

<p>“A bad habit, ma’am?” said
Josephine, looking up at Mrs.
Lee, as though she thought
it very strange that she should
have a bad habit.</p>

<p>“Yes, my child. I noticed
it when you first came here.
It has made you very unpopular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
with your playmates.
When I went to the picnic
this afternoon, I found that
nearly all the girls were glad
you had left them. They all
said Katy and Jenny had
done just right in leaving
you.”</p>

<p>“It was very rude of them,”
said Josephine, beginning to
cry. “I haven’t done any
thing to make them hate me
so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I hope they don’t <i>hate</i>
you, but they don’t like you.
I do not wonder that they
don’t like you, either. You
may call it rude, but the girls
can never like you while you
try to make servants of them.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Lee!” exclaimed
Josephine.</p>

<p>“You may be surprised,
but I have seen you send
Flora upon a dozen errands
in half an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“I have asked her to do
something for me very often,
perhaps; but I only asked it
as a favor.”</p>

<p>“One should not ask too
many favors. Now let me
give you a rule, which I hope
you will follow. <i>Never ask
others to do for you what you
can just as well do yourself.</i>
You will have to ask many
favors of your friends; and
they will most cheerfully confer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
them, if you do not ask
too many.”</p>

<p>“The girls said I was always
asking them to do something
for me. But I am sure
I did not mean any thing
wrong, and I will try to do
better.”</p>

<p>“You are very polite to
your playmates,” added Mrs.
Lee; “and politeness is a
good thing in a little girl;
but we should be sure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
it is true politeness, for there
are two kinds.”</p>

<p>“I never knew there was
more than one kind of politeness,”
said Josephine.</p>

<p>“There are two kinds: one
which comes from a kind
heart, and which is a desire
to promote the happiness of
others. The other kind is
nothing but cunning—such
as the fox practises when he
wants to catch a chicken. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
is selfish—put on to make
others do as you wish them
to do. I am afraid your politeness
was somewhat of the
latter kind.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to know it, and
I will try to do better.”</p>

<p>And she did try to do
better. Though she did not
at first succeed, her friends
saw that she was trying to
improve, and they were very
kind and very indulgent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
her; so that before she returned
to New York, she was
liked as well as any other little
girl in Riverdale.</p>
